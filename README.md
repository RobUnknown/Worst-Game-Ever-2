# Worst Game Ever 2
A successor to Worst Game Ever 1 (which was played in a command prompt and coded in Lua) that is coded in Python and has an actual storyline, meaning that it is actually the second to worst game ever.
Just like WGE 1 it is also played in a command prompt.

Could one day probably be turned into a Discord bot.

Feel free to make suggestions or pull requests or whatever.
